    <div class="headtwo"><h3>Description</h3></div>
    <p>The dish evolved centuries ago as pieces of meat cooked with batter as a way to stretch out the meat and make a filling meal. There is a story that Toad in the Hole originated from a town in Northumberland. The local golf course was overrun with toads and a chef in the town devised the dish with sausages as a joke to resemble the toads poking their heads out of the holes on the golf course.</p>
    <p>Despite the weird name, it is a great tasting dish.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Place the sausages in a large metal tray, add the olive oil and cook the sausages for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flours and baking powder.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre and pour in the wet ingredients. Stir it all together until you have a smooth batter. Let the batter rest whilst the sausages cook.</li>
        <li>Remove the tray from the oven and pour over the batter. Add in half the red onion and a few sprigs of rosemary. Quickly place the tray back in the oven on the middle shelf for 30 minutes.</li>
